### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Denisnjeru/Business_Central_Practical_Test.git
   cd Business_Central_Practical_Test

2. Add a launch json and specify the instance of business central 24.0.0.0 running locally on your machine.

3. Change the port to refer to the one currently tied to the version of business central running locally on your machine.

### Alternatively use the (Ctrl + Shift + B) command to build the app (an .app file) that can be used to publish the application directly on the powershell



### Project Structure

1. **.gitignore** 
List of blobs for git to ignore. Affects commands like git add and git clean. You may use gitignore.io to generate a clean and useful gitignore file.

2. **.alpackages/**
Folder in a Business Central project functions as a local repository for extension packages (.app files) that your project depends on, including Microsoft base extensions, third-party extensions, and your own referenced extensions. This critical directory enables the AL compiler to resolve symbol definitions from dependencies, providing IntelliSense support and ensuring proper code compilation during development.

3. **.test/**
Unit tests, integration testsâ€¦ go here.



### Summary of what was done 
1. I extended the Sales Header Table and added the two new fields.
2. I extended the Sales Heder Page and also added the two new fields but only visible if the document type is Order.
3. Added validation on the OnAction trigger of Posting to prevent posting if Delivery Method is Courier and Document Type if Order.
5. Added the same validation on the subscriptions OnBeforeConfirmPost and OnBeforeConfirmPostAndSend events.
6. Created the Delivery Instruction Log Table.
7. On the OnModify Trigger Action on the Sales Header table I added an extra procedure that checks if the 'Delivery Instruction' field has been changed it logs on the previously created table
